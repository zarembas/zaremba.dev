# [zaremba.dev](https://zaremba.dev)

A static single-page site showcasing the third-party Mac applications I use daily. Built as a single `index.html` with zero dependencies and no build step.

## Hosting

Deployed on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com). Push to `main` and it's live — no framework, no config needed.

## Stack

- Vanilla HTML, CSS, JS
- Google Fonts (Inter + JetBrains Mono)
- No build tools, no bundler, no node_modules
